# PalMirror

**PalMirror** is an opinionated, open-source chat client designed for creating, and interacting with characters. It provides a modern, private, and flexible alternative to similar AI chat platforms.  

Try PalMirror through the [demo](https://palmirror.vercel.app).

## Features

- **Character Chatting**
  - AI chat optimized for roleplay chatting.
  - Employs transparent prompt injections for a greater experience.

- **PalMirror Experience — Proprietary character format)**  
  - *Dynamic Status*: Characters can update their status based on user interactions.  
  - *Invocations*: Trigger small actions such as sound effects, speech snippets, or visuals.  

- **PalMirror Secure**  
  - Encrypt chats locally.  
  - API keys are stored encrypted, never as raw text.
  - **Required** for chat persistence—else everything will be ephemeral. 

- **Compatibility**  
  - Supports importing characters from other platforms.  
  - Optimized for mobile, but also usable on desktop.
